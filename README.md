📝 Detailed Explanation:



1️⃣ Organize the Backend Folder Structure
The backend of your application should be organized into different folders based on their function. This helps ensure that your code is scalable, easy to navigate, and maintainable.

📌 Suggested Folder Structure for Backend:

models/ – This folder contains all the data models (schemas) that define how the data is structured in the database.
Each model represents a collection in your MongoDB database. For example, you might have a Task.js model and a User.js model.
controllers/ – This folder includes the controller functions that handle the business logic for your API endpoints.
Controllers receive requests, process data, interact with models, and send back responses.
routes/ – This folder contains route files that define the API endpoints for your app.
Each route file will group related routes, for example, taskRoutes.js for task-related endpoints and userRoutes.js for user-related endpoints.
config/ – This folder stores configuration files that set up important settings like database connections or environment variables.
For example, you may have a db.js file for setting up MongoDB connection or a config.js file for various configuration needs.
middleware/ – In this folder, you would define functions that are executed before hitting your route handlers.
Examples include authentication middleware (for verifying JWT tokens) or error handling middleware.
utils/ – A place for utility functions that might be used across your application, such as custom helper functions or reusable logic.
